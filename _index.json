If you are looking at this more than a week or two after savage release, they may not be applicable to you.\n\nThese sets fall into three categories, each with a slightly different purpose.\n- Full Crafted sets consist only of fully pentamelded crafted gear, and are the best achievable without spending time farming tomes. These are good if money is not a constraint and you do not have time to farm for tomes (e.g., if racing for a fast clear).\n- 1 Tome piece sets use the first week of tomes to get slightly better results than the full crafted sets. We recommend using these sets if you are willing to invest in pentamelded crafted gear, but also have the time to get tomes. They will be the best-performing sets at their speeds for week 1.\n- Budget sets use a mixture of gear to minimize the cost of pentamelded crafted gear. Since budgets vary, these should be taken as basic examples --- you can of course put more melds on your crafted gear if budget allows.\n\nSpeeds:\n2.50 will generally result in better damage, but you may find other speeds more comfortable.
